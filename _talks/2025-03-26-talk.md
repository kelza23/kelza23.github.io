### *Abstract*
In this session, our speakers from the Institute for Intelligent Systems Research and Innovation, Deakin University, Australia, aim to provide a comprehensive exploration of the latest advancements and practical applications of AI in transportation systems. The speakers, Prof. CP Lim, Dr. Tao, and Mr. Kelvin Choo, have extensive experience in collaborating with industrial partners to apply AI in solving real-world problems. They will share their unique insights and practical knowledge, with a particular focus on the field of transportation systems. The topics they will cover include "Artificial Intelligence and its Applications," "Reinforcement Learning in Intelligent Transportation Systems," and "AI-based Decision Support Systems."

### *Speaker's Profile*
#### Topic: “Reinforcement Learning in Intelligent Transportation System”
**Tao Zhou** received his Ph.D. degree from the Curtin University, Australia, in 2019. He is currently working as a research fellow at the Institute for Intelligent Systems Research and Innovation (IISRI). His research focuses on intelligent and data-driven algorithms and their applications. He has published high-quality research papers in top journals in areas across operations research, deep learning, and reinforcement learning. He also serves as a reviewer for journals such as Expert Systems with Applications, Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies, and Computers and Operations Research. Tao has extensive experience in leading industry-fund projects and successfully converted conceptual AI-enabled algorithms into practical applications.

#### Topic: “AI-based Decision Support System”
**Kelvin Choo** finished his Ph.D. at the Institute for Intelligent Systems Research and Innovation (IISRI), Deakin University, Australia. His research focuses on developing state-of-the-art multi-objective optimisation algorithms and applying them to solve real-world problems. His project is a joint PhD program with the Rail Manufacturing Cooperative Research Centre (RMCRC), working on optimising the maintenance schedules for rolling stocks with industrial partners in Melbourne and Sydney. Specifically, he utilises advanced data analytics to extract information from complex databases and develops an evolutionary-based decision support tool to assist industrial partners in formulating an optimal maintenance schedule for rolling stocks. He also collaborates with transportation industry partners to develop AI-based tools for video and image analytics.
