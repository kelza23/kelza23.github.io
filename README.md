## **1\. Building the Foundation: An Education in Application**

Kelvin's academic path was defined by a focus on solving real-world challenges. His journey began with a **Bachelor of Civil Engineering**, completed through a prestigious International Degree Programme between **UCSI University** in Malaysia and **Deakin University** in Australia, where he graduated with **First Class Honours**.

He continued his studies at Deakin’s esteemed **Institute for Intelligent Systems Research and Innovation (IISRI)**, undertaking a **Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Engineering**. His PhD was not a purely theoretical exercise; it was a practical, industry-sponsored program in partnership with the **Rail Manufacturing CRC** and **Downer Group**. The core objective was to create an AI-powered decision support system designed to solve a critical industry problem: optimizing maintenance schedules for rolling stock (trains).

**Key Outcomes:**

* **Developed:** State-of-the-art optimisation algorithms and machine learning models to solve real-world transportation challenges.  
* **Created:** An AI-powered decision support system to provide optimal maintenance schedules for planners and schedulers.  
* **Collaborated:** Directly with industry partners in Melbourne and Sydney to understand and solve their most pressing operational challenges.

## **2\. The Industrial Impact: Applying AI to Transportation and Defence**

Kelvin Choo's career is a testament to the power of translating complex AI research into practical tools for major industry partners. As a **Research Fellow** at IISRI, he has led industry-funded programs that deploy AI, optimisation, and computer vision to solve critical operational problems.

**Key Projects:**

| Project & Partner | Contribution & Impact |  
| Decision Support System for Rollingstock Maintenance (Downer Group) | Tackled a critical logistics challenge by transforming complex historical data into an optimized, predictive maintenance schedule. By processing and modelling extensive maintenance records, he used machine learning to forecast task durations and implemented custom multi-objective optimisation algorithms to derive optimal schedules, directly addressing operational bottlenecks. |  
| SASI Safe2Go DriverAssist (Alstom Australia) | Drove the R\&D for a system designed to proactively detect and mitigate safety risks on public transport. Managed the entire project lifecycle, from stakeholder engagement to technical design, effectively bridging the gap from a conceptual pilot to a viable prototype focused on enhancing passenger safety through computer vision and edge inference. |  
| VR Training Efficacy (FLAIM Systems) | Served as Lead Chief Investigator evaluating the efficacy of Virtual Reality (VR) in land mine sweeping training. His success in building these diverse partnerships is underscored by his ability to secure and contribute to over AUD 2M in industry and collaborative grants. |

## **3\. The Passion Project: Coaching, Strategy, and Sports Analytics**

For Kelvin, **Ultimate Frisbee** is far more than a hobby—it is a laboratory for leadership, strategy, and the application of data analytics.

**Leadership Trajectory:**

* **Player & Treasurer:** Geelong Mudlarks Ultimate Frisbee Club (4x National Championships).  
* **Assistant Coach (2022):** Victorian U22 Mixed team.  
* **Head Coach (2023):** Victorian U22 team (Australian Under-22 Ultimate Championships).  
* **Scholarship Recipient:** Awarded the prestigious **Ellipsis Coaching Scholarship**.
