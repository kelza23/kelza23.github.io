This chapter provides an elaboration on the agricultural productivity, resources, and waste management of Asian countries particularly on its high-value crops such as rice, corn, pineapple, coconut, sugarcane, and oil palm. It presents a comprehensive detail on the biomass waste generation from the various crops, its characteristics, and the different thermal conversion processes of agricultural wastes into biochar. The authors aim to provide an effective way to efficiently utilize the agricultural wastes into value-added products as current state of the art in bioenergy generation and utilization for sustainable and green technology innovation.
