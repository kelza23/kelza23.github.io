I was the head coach of the 2023 Victoria U22 Mixed team, the Greater Bilbies. I led them to compete at the Australian U22 Ultimate Championships, which took place from July 7-9, 2023 at Bill Norris Oval in Beenleigh, Queensland. Although the team finished in 4th place, it was an incredible experience to coach such a talented group of young players with so much potential.
