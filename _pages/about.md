I am a passionate and innovative engineering professional with a track record of excellence. I currently hold the position of Research Fellow in Operations Analytics at the Institute for Intelligent Systems Research and Innovation (IISRI) at Deakin University. My primary role involves spearheading cutting-edge research to optimise operations in complex transportation networks, which builds upon my extensive experience. I have a Doctor of Philosophy (Engineering) from Deakin University, where my research focused on improving Integrated Operation Centres (IOCs) and developing state-of-the-art optimisation algorithms and machine learning models. I have also presented my findings at numerous national and international conferences. My journey started with a Bachelor of Civil Engineering (Honours) at Deakin University, where my final year project was recognized for its industry collaboration. Additionally, my practical experience as a Student Engineer at the City of Greater Geelong has honed my problem-solving skills. I am eager to explore opportunities that allow me to apply my expertise and drive innovation in the engineering domain. Let's connect and explore potential collaborations.
